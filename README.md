# Medieval Lords Bosses 

### Reason for this repository ###
The reason I made this is for the future generations of the server who would like to contribute. 
This isn't specifically for the current developers, but for players wanting to contribute to the server.

### Explanation of what this all is ###
All of these folders contain data on the bosses of the server. The "mobs" folder contains all the bosses
with some of their skills, drops etc. The skills folder contains the more complex skills that are separate and the 
drops folder contains the drops of the bosses.

### How could I create a boss? ###
